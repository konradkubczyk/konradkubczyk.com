                PREAMBLE<br>
                The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font
                projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a
                free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
            </p>
            <p class="single-license__paragraph">
                The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they
                are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
                redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative
                works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
                requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the
                fonts or their derivatives.

                "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).

            <p class="single-license__paragraph">
                "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting -- in part or
                in whole -- any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font
                Software to a new environment.
